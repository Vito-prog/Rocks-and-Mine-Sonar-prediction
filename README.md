# 🧠 Rocks vs Mines Sonar Prediction

A binary classification machine learning project that uses sonar frequency data to distinguish between rocks and mines. Built using Python and scikit-learn with a focus on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Features**: 60 sonar readings per object  
- **Target**: `Rock` or `Mine`

## 🚀 How it Works

1. Load and explore the dataset using Pandas
2. Preprocess and split the data (features/labels)
3. Train a Logistic Regression model
4. Evaluate performance using accuracy score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧪 Model Performance

- Train accuracy: ~83%
- Test accuracy: ~78%

> You can tweak the model or try other algorithms (e.g. SVM, Random Forest) for comparison.

## 📊 Future Improvements

- Add hyperparameter tuning
- Try cross-validation for more stable results
- Test different classification models and ensemble methods
